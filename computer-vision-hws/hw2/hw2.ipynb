Anyway none of the selected detectors performed well when matching etalons with an image which was not containing the etalon. Our results on selected 2 images can be seen in the *Task3Results* for each 3 feature detectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the second and third images are results of SIFT with Flann based & SIFT with BruteForce, those results are great because we exactly found etalons on the images, this etalons were also rotated and our matching functions didnt have any troubles with correct matching. Next example of SIFT with Flann based $ SIFT with BruteForce are in Task3Results folder where we were comparing the same etalons but with another images.\n"
